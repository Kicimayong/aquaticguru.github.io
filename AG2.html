            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>In 2023, I came across an article with a surprising statistic: 70% of adult Malaysians couldn't swim. It left me stunned  — a staggering 70% of adult Malaysians, equivalent to 16 million individuals, couldn't swim. It surprised me so much that I couldn't help but wonder: How could so many miss out on the sheer joy, thrill, and love that I've always found in the embrace of the water? 
            That was the moment the spark ignited. I couldn't imagine a world where swimming wasn't universally adored. So, with an unwavering passion, through trial and error Aquatic Guru was founded , determined to rewrite the narrative of adult swimming education in Malaysia.  In less than a year, our vision gained momentum, sprouting franchises in Subang , Ipoh, Kampar, and Penang. Aquatic Guru wasn't just a brand; it was a movement — a call to arms for adults to experience the magic of swimming.
            This is my story, the story of Aquatic Guru. From the shocking realization to the nationwide revolution, every stroke and ripple reflect the dedication to making swimming not just a skill but a way of life.  Join us at Aquatic Guru, where passion meets purpose, and everyone is invited to fall in love with swimming. Just as we've helped thousands of adults before, let us guide you on your journey to aquatic joy. </p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>It's disheartening to admit , but in Malaysia, many swimming institutions tend to focus on coaching children, leaving adults behind. Even when adult classes are offered, they often lack the dedication and passion needed to truly help you learn. Instead, you may find yourself surrounded by children 3 times younger than you, making the learning experience more awkward and less effective.But here at aquatic guru we challenge the old age saying of  " you can't teach an old dog new tricks "We specialize in teaching adults, offering you a second chance to learn and enjoy swimming.  Our philosophy is simple yet profound: we want to foster a genuine love for swimming. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to learn, regardless of age. Imagine growing older with the satisfaction of realizing you never gave up on swimming—a skill and joy that stays with you throughout life. </p>
